# A_project(V1.0)
Simulates a projectile that neglects air resistance.


- Uses Constant acceleration kinematics equations
- Initial velocity calculated based on string displacement
- Velocity of x-y component calculated using trigonometry func


Note:
- Projectile will only travel towards the right side of the screen(fix in-progress).


Requirements:
- gfx library for c.
- gcc compiler if you wanna edit


Coming updates:
- Targets that will has a score if hit by projectile
- (-ve)velocity thus projectile may displace towards the left
- Scoring system
